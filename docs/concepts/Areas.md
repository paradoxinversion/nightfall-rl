# Areas

Areas represent large locations in the game. Areas are a supplement to the game map, providing data about the Plots and other objects within them. Areas will determine how the entities and objects within them are generated.

Areas contain Plots. Plots are basically parcels of land that can be owned, with buildings associated with them. Using plots should help organize the generation of buildings and towns.
